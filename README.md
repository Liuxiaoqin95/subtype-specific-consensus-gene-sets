Subtype-Stratified Consensus Gene Signatures: Bridging Tumor Cell Biology, Immune Microenvironment, and Clinical Prognosis in Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is characterized by profound molecular heterogeneity, which severely limits the clinical utility of universal prognostic tools. To address this gap, we systematically explored transcriptomic profiles in three independent breast cancer cohorts (TCGA, METABRIC, SCAN-B) via unsupervised clustering. We identified both pan-cancer and PAM50 subtype-specific consensus prognostic gene signatures through log-rank tests and cross-cohort intersection, yielding pan-cancer prognosis genes and unique signature sets for each subtype. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)-derived prognosis scores strongly stratified overall survival across all cohorts. Functional enrichment via KEGG pathway analysis uncovered subtype-specific biological mechanisms: immune-related pathways (antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling pathway) dominated good prognosis signatures in HER2-enriched and Basal-like tumors, while oncogenic pathways (PI3K-Akt, TGF-β signaling) characterized poor prognosis sets. Correlation analysis with CIBERSORT-deconvolved immune cell proportions revealed that good prognosis scores positively correlated with anti-tumor immune cells (CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages) and negatively with pro-tumor cells (M2 macrophages, Tregs). Independent validation in the Lancet2005 ER+ cohort confirmed that Luminal prognosis signatures robustly stratified distant relapse-free survival. Collectively, these subtype-specific consensus signatures integrate tumor cell biology and tumor immune microenvironment features, offering robust, clinically translatable tools for personalized breast cancer prognostication and therapy guidance.
